# Covid-19-Face-Mask-Detection
Ever since the pandemic happened, wearing a face mask has become the new normal. 
This got me thinking to develop a machine learning model which could detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in a photo or a video
My program uses a Binary classification process which analyses the dataset on two parts 
the first one is the mask ones and the second one is non-mask photos.
